A simple web app that renders a 3D heart using the `Three.js` library. It features the ability to orbit around the heart by holding a left click, zoom in and out with the scroll wheel, and even move the camera with a right click (or their equivalent on a trackpad or a touchscreen). In addition, there is a start beating animation triggered by a click or touch event.
